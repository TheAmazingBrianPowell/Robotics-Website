# Adding photos
The photos were not included in the source code, because they are not needed here.
To add photos:
1. Create a new directory in the directory with the current year
2. It's name should be a representation of the event the photo was taken at
3. Add the index.php from the example event directory at Robotics-Website/photos/2018-2019/event/index.php to the directory
4. Add photos to that directory
