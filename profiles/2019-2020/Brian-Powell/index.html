    <p>&#8195Hello, I am the main programmer for Aries, and the creator of this website. I program in HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Python, Java, SQL, and a few libraries of Javascript. I play three instruments and participate in two sports (Cross Country and Tennis) as well as one club (Robotics!).<br><br>&#8195I enjoy working on large projects, such as this one, and creating new things. I am currently working towards getting a job in the web development area, as well as building more projects and entering programming contests.<br><br>&#8195To future web developers of this site: before editing any code, make sure you read all the comments on all the pages! Also, remember, this site needs to serve everyone possible, whether that means adding accesibility features, or making sure it is compatible with as many browsers and devices possible! Use responsive design!</p>
